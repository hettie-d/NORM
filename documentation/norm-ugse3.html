<!--l. 143--><p class="noindent" >All data transfers between an application and a database operate on sets of
hierarchically structured objects. In terms of old classical database textbooks (does
anyone read them?), NORM provides a hierarchical data model, although the data
structures in the database itself can be more complex.
<!--l. 145--><p class="indent" >   Typically, an application needs multiple hierarchies supporting different business
functions that might be implemented even as different microservices can still share
some parts of stored data.
<!--l. 147--><p class="indent" >   In order to enable NORM performance benefits, each hierarchy should include all
data needed for a specific business function. For example, the booking service
includes complete flight information. The same flight information is also included in
the timetable service.
<!--l. 149--><p class="indent" >   The designer should remember that hierarchies are assembled when requested
rather than stored anywhere in the database. Consequently, there is no need to avoid
redundancy in the definitions of hierarchies. There are better ideas than just using
hierarchies that only partially meet application needs and combining data from
different hierarchies on the application side. A new hierarchy that perfectly meets
application requirements should be defined instead. Of course, an application
function may require data from different hierarchies. For example, to re-book a
passenger to another flight, access to the timetable is needed to find a new flight, as
the booking hierarchy includes flights for the booking rather than a complete
timetable.
<!--l. 151--><p class="indent" >   However, the number of hierarchies and data transfers must be kept reasonably
small. A proven method to get extremely poor performance with NORM is to
define a hierarchy for each database table and transfer only one row in each
request.
