<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent" >This section briefly outlines the NORM approach and the problems that it addresses.
More detailed descriptions can be found in numerous conference talks, blogs, posts,
and a book on PostgreSQL query optimization.
<!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >   The origin of NORM is not clear as it goes back into the dark ages. Some sources
insist it stands for &#8217;No ORM,&#8217; where ORM is &#8217;an object-relational mapper,&#8217; but this
looks doubtful even though the authors insist.

<!--l. 16--><p class="indent" >   It is more likely that NORM addresses the impedance mismatch, first identified in
the dark ages (before the Internet) when powerful database query languages started
becoming practical.
<!--l. 18--><p class="indent" >   The models and languages widely used in the database world significantly differ
from the application models and languages. Consequently, the interactions between
an information system&#8217;s database and application parts result in severe problems
affecting development, maintenance, and performance. Several attempts were
made to resolve this, but they have failed. Any attempt to adjust one of the
models to the needs of others results in poor design on the adjusted side. For
example, ORMs attempt to enforce application models on the database side,
effectively turning off the powerful capabilities of database management
systems.
<!--l. 20--><p class="indent" >   Thus, any serious attempt to resolve the impedance mismatch must accept that
models differ. The approach of NORM is to leave both interacting sides with their
favorite models and define yet another model for their interaction. Thus, NORM
requires two mappings instead of one: the intermediate transfer model must be
mapped to both the application and the database.
<!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   The advantages are not so obvious. Neither of the mappings must be complete in
any sense. The model and language used for the interaction can be tailored to data
transfer. Both mappings may preserve (map) complex data structures on both
sides.
<!--l. 24--><p class="indent" >   NORM improves the application performance by transferring as much data as
possible in any interaction and thus reducing the number of network round
trips.
<!--l. 26--><p class="indent" >   The data transfer unit in NORM is a hierarchical document called hierarchy for
brevity. An example of a hierarchy is an airfare booking that includes some
heare information, a list of passengers, and a list of booking legs linking the
booking to scheduled flights. Another example is the manifest, which contains
information on a flight and everything loaded onto the aircraft (passengers and/or
cargo).
<!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >   A hierarchy is the most straightforward data structure that is more complex than
flat files (lick CSV or plan SQL output). At the same time, it is the most complex
structure that can be easily represented sequentially. That is why it is widely
accepted for formats used to transfer data over the network (SGML, XML,
JSON).
